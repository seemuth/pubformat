Publication Formatter
=====================

This tool takes BibTeX publications as input and formats them nicely as HTML lists.

To use:

1. Open pubformat.html in a browser.
2. Type the author's last name into the "Publication list author name" text box.
3. Copy your BibTeX source into the top (large) text box.
4. On any keypress in the top text box (e.g., pasting the source using a shortcut), the publications will be reformatted and will be displayed under "Post Output".
5. You may refine the publication filtering using the options shown underneath the top (large) text box.
6. Copy the formatted output lists and paste wherever you would like.

This tool was created at the University of Wisconsin - Madison by Daniel P. Seemuth.
